 The SRMonthPicker class implements an object that uses multiple rotating
 wheels to allow users to select a month and year.  This is similar to both
 iOS's UIDatePicker set to Date-only mode without the day element and Mobile
 Safari's picker view that appears for an `<input type="month" />` tag.

 Unlike UIDatePicker, SRMonthPicker does inherit from UIPickerView.  It does
 use both UIPickerViewDataSource and UIPickerViewDelegate, but presents a
 monthPickerDelegate property.
